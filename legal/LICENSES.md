# License

For open source software, they are a variety of widely-used licenses. Click [here](https://opensource.org) for more info.

I choose the MIT license for my personal project due to its simplicity and shortness. [^1]

# Disclaimer

I include a [DISCLAMER](/legal/DISCLAIMER) file that includes all the licenses that my dependencies use.
That file is generated by running:

`yarn licenses generate-disclaimer`
